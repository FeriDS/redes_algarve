\noindent
Albert went to a Networking conference in which he was contacted to analyse the Wireshark network
file capture that's hosted at \href{conference.pcapng}{https://xxxx/conference.pcapng}.

\bigskip

\noindent Help Albert analyse the network traffic with WireShark! The goal of this challenge is
  to get comfortable with WireShark; you don't need to understand everything yet.
